        <p> Hi, my name is Caleb and sometimes I make noodles.   &nbsp;
            This is a web-site for a mock restaurant.  &nbsp;I feel like I just need to put that out there. &nbsp;
            Unlike my competitors, all of my noodles are made in-house, from scratch and always with the most important ingredient&mdash;love.  &nbsp;
            Also unlike my competitors, I spell the word "house" and not "haus" because I'm not a pretentious bastard.&nbsp;  Also, everything on the menu is gluten-ous and will probably kill you.  &nbsp; 
            Just kidding.  &nbsp;  Gluten allergies are not the serious &nbsp;  As of writing this, I only make one non-wheat-based kind of noodle&mdash;pho. &nbsp; 
        </p>
        <h2>We Offer...</h2>

                <p>Japanese and wheat-based noodles that are so thick and squooshy.  &nbsp;These are made from scratch with four ingredients; wheat flour, water, salt and <em>love</em>.</p>
